# You and mulle-objc

If you care about the project, it is important to become a public member,
to give it more weight in the open software community:

# Politics

<b><tt>mulle-objc</tt></b> runs on <b>Linux</b>, <b>FreeBSD</b>,
<b>MacOS</b> and <b>Windows</b>. There is nothing that should prevent it
from running on Android or any other OS, that's 32 bit or more.
As long as there is C and clang compiles for it,
Objective-C works too. If your code is compatible with
<b><tt>mulle-objc</tt></b> it has gained, by the mere existence of this
project, portability and longevity and therefore worth.

<p>
It would be nice to lobby <b><tt>mulle-objc</tt></b> into debian.

<p>The compiler is a fork of <a href="//clang.llvm.org/">clang</a>. One
of the main goals of the community is to integrate the compiler
changes back into the mainline of <b>clang</b>.
For that "Evidence of a significant user community" is one of the
requirements.
